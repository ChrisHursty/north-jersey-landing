# North Jersey Specialists WordPress Theme

This folder contains a WordPress theme generated from the Lovable project.
Copy the `njspecialists` directory to your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory and activate it.

Run `npm run build` in the project root to generate updated assets if you make changes to the React code. Copy the contents of `dist/assets` into `wp-content/themes/njspecialists/assets`.

The theme exposes settings for the hero tagline and contact phone under **Appearance → Customize → Hero Settings**.

Optional assets such as `favicon.ico` and `screenshot.png` are intentionally excluded. You can add your own versions of these files inside the theme directory if desired.
